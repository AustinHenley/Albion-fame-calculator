      <p>With Albion being a big game heavily based on fame, sometimes you might need a little help. Fear not! Help is here! With this tool you will be able to figure out how many of those creatures you need to kill, how many daggers you need to craft, how much crops needed for that next tier. The best part is it's free for life and open source! Wait there's more! Since this is made in Java it works on all platforms!</p>

<p>Current version 0.1 alpha:
Currently only supports one creature from each tier and only PvE is supported.</p>

<p>Upcoming features:
Support all creatures, PvP, GvG, farming, crafting, and all other ways you earn fame. Sometime in the future will come a pretty GUI!</p>
